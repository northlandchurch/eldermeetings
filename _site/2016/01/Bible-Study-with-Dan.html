<h2 id="how-to-study-the-bible-outline">How to Study the Bible Outline</h2>

<p><strong>Number one factor in growth in Christ likeness is Bible engagement.</strong></p>

<p>The Word of God has a power all its own:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the beginning God spoke and His word produced out of nothing.</li>
  <li>Isaiah tells us God’s Word will not return void but do what He intends it to do.</li>
  <li>It is compared to a two edged sword that cuts between bone and marrow.</li>
  <li>Jesus was the Word made flesh and He came in power. To become more like Him we must know the Word.</li>
  <li>Paul urged that we be diligent workman who can rightly handle the Word of Truth.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="basic-rules">Basic Rules</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Scripture must interpret Scripture</strong>, Jesus does this example discussion on divorce and His use of Genesis 2:24</li>
  <li><strong>Didactic must shed light on Narrative</strong>, Acts compared to 1 Corinthians 12</li>
  <li><strong>The more clear must inform the less clear</strong>, All scripture is God breathed so it is not in conflict with itself. If we don’t understand a passage or think it conflicts with something that is clear, then we need to rethink in light of the clear passage.</li>
  <li><strong>It should lead to Christ and the Gospel</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>John 5:39 – Jesus said that the Pharisees search the scriptures and so they should have received Him because the scriptures point to Him.</li>
      <li>We can get lost in the minutia and never get to Jesus, i.e. Study the tabernacle in the Old Testament and never see that the purpose is to point to Jesus who according to John 1 came and dwelt, literally tabernacled or pitched His tent, among us. Be sure to look for the overarching teaching of redemption, the Gospel, the Messiah and our human need for grace.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Bible is just like and completely unlike every other book.</strong> So the rules of studying literature are the same, yet the power of the Bible makes it unique.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Most Important: The Holy Spirit must be consulted</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="context-is-crucial--it-is-the-most-often-overlooked-and-yet-the-easiest-to-correct">Context is Crucial – it is the most often overlooked and yet the easiest to correct.</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Immediate</strong> - Ephesians 5:21-6:9 You cannot divorce verse 21 from 22 and you can’t stop at the end of chapter 5.</li>
  <li><strong>Book</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Especially in historical books, what has already happened?</li>
      <li>Even in other books example – Paul’s letters have a context in terms of who they were written to and what the culture was.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Bible</strong> - Where in the Bible does it fall?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="genre-matters">Genre Matters</h3>
<p>We read narratives differently from poetry and from proverbs or prophecy, etc.</p>

<h3 id="questions-to-ask">Questions to Ask:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Observation – What do we see in the text?</li>
  <li>Interpretation – What does it mean?</li>
  <li>Application – How should it change the way I follow Jesus?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ways-to-study">Ways to study</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Master a book.</li>
  <li>Topical.</li>
  <li>Word.</li>
</ul>
